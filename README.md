# PDFmerge_windows
windows exe for merging pdf. Written in Python

I am maintaining this to support my SO's parents' business. Feel free to use it for any purpose.

How to Use:
1. Down the zip file and unpack
2. run the .exe

Don't worry about the .py file. It's only there if you want to extend it using python.
