# PDFmerge_windows
windows exe for merging pdf. Written in Python

The PDFmerge.exe is created via pyinstaller using only PDFmerge.py

Project Abstract:
In this talk I am going to demonstrate how to make a simple pdf merger tool complete with graphical user interface (gui) using tkinter and PyPDF2. Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI package while PyPDF2 provides a strong util that allows developers to manage PDFs in Python

Without Adobe Acrobat, your choices in merging pdf files is sort of limited. You either have to use online merging tools, which most likely collects your data, or you will have to make a decision on which third party pdf editor to learn, use, and trust. Faced with this dilemma, I chose to make my own pdf merger, which was made incredibly simple by Python language.
