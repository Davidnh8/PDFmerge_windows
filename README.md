# PDFmerge_windows

I am maintaining this to support my SO's parents' business. Feel free to use it or alter for any purpose.

Contains:
1. windows exe & .py for merging pdf files
2. .py for converting docx to pdf

How to Use:
1. Download the zip file and unpack
2. run the .exe file or run .py with python 3 (after 'pip install -r requirements')
3. add pdf or docx files and execute

Note that docx to pdf requires microsoft word to be installed locally. It doesn't have to be activated
